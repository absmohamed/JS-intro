# Classes

## Static properties and methods (class level properties)

Just like in other languages, we can define static properties and methods on classes. These properties and methods act on the class itself, instead of an instance of the class.

## Inheritance

We can use inheritance to define a more specific definition for a particular type of object. This allows us to define general or common properties and methods in one class, then extend the general class to define something more specific.
